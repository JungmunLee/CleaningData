**The goal of this project is to prepare tidy data that can be used for later analysis**


## Included files:

- **'README.md'**

- **'CodeBook.md'** : describes the variables, the data, and any transformations

- **'tidy_data.txt'** : a created text file by 'run_analysis.R' script

   Column 1: "subject"
   
   Column 2: "activity"
   
   Column 3 ~ 68: the average of mean/standard variables for each "subject" and "activity"
   
   _The details are described in_ 'CodeBook.md'

- **'run_analysis.R'** : a script that performs following instructions

      Step 1.Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set.
 
      Step 2.Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement.
 
      Step 3.Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set
 
      Step 4.Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names. 
 
      Step 5.From the data set in step 4, creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.
